Hello :waving hand, My Name is Raghav, I am a Graduate Student at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York majoring in Robotics with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. A Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Algorithms enthusiast, I love working with Data and Algorithms. I have over 3 years of work experience as a Software Engineer in the FullStack space having worked in Frontend, Backend and Data engineering. I possess strong analytical thinking ability as well as core technical skills.

My current research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision. I have been involved in the CUBS(Center for Unified Biometrics) / CEDAR (Center for Document Analysis and Recognition) Labs at University at Buffalo wherein i worked on state of the art Deep Learning models that can detect various objects of interest in any image given their exemplar features. Throughout my research experience and the courses that i have taken as part of my graduate study i have gained skills in the areas of Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Deep Learning. I hope to utilize my skillset in whichever organization i work in the future so that i can create a positive impact along with growing my skillsets.
